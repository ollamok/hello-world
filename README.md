Lesson on creating repositories
I am Sandra Adcock...pharmacist with a lot of varied experience and skills. Now it seems I am adding soft core computer programing to this skill set...see my Linkedin Profile at http://linkedin.com/in/sandra-lynn-adcock-601b7015.
This will br good. It never hurts to add to one's skill set. 
I plan to start a business and write a book.
i hope learning Linux isn't too frustrating for me.
